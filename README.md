# CrewAI-LangGraph-Email-Management-System

#  Description: This project demonstrates how to use CrewAI in conjunction with LangChain and LangGraph to automate the management of incoming emails. The system consists of three autonomous agents, each designed for a specific purpose:

Email Filtering Agent: Filters incoming emails to remove non-essential ones (e.g., notifications, promotions) and identifies important emails that require attention.

Email Actionable Agent: Analyzes emails and prioritizes them based on urgency and importance, identifying which emails require a response.

Email Response Agent: Drafts accurate and logical responses to the identified important emails, streamlining the user's communication process.

# Technologies:
# CrewAI: Orchestrates the autonomous AI agents, enabling them to collaborate and execute complex tasks efficiently.
# LangGraph: Defines the relationships between agents using nodes and edges, allowing for seamless task management.

# Use Cases:
Assisting professionals with heavy email traffic by automating email filtering and response generation.
Saving time by automating email management processes.
Ensuring effective communication with timely and appropriate email responses.
